# partexchange
FRC Parts Exchange website

Created by Blaze Robotics initially in 2014. Allows teams to request parts from others in a craigslist-style way.

Keeps track of parts requested and given.

We plan to test this site over the 2016 preseason, and release it fully for MN teams by kickoff this year
